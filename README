## Introduction

SkyFireONE(aka SFO) is a MMORPG Framework based mostly on C++. 
It is completely open source; community involvement is highly encouraged.
 
SFO was derived from multiple sources(MangOS, Trinity, OregonCore, etc)
the Massive Network Game Object Servers, and is based on 
the code of there projects with extensive changes over time 
to optimize, improve and cleanup the codebase at the same 
time as improving the ingame mechanics and functionality.
