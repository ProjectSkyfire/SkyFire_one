__SkyFireONE(aka SFO)__ is a MMORPG Framework based mostly on C++.     
It is completely open source; current source now community supported.
``` 
SFO was derived from multiple sources(MangOS, Trinity, OregonCore,etc)     
the Massive Network Game Object Servers, and is based from 
the code of their projects with extensive changes over time 
to optimize, improve and cleanup the codebase at the same 
time as improving the ingame mechanics and functionality.
